Canâ€™t Touch This: Real-Time, Safe Motion Planning and Control for Manipulators Under Uncertainty

## Dependency
The repo has been verified on Matlab R>=2021b and Ubuntu >= 20.04

This repo depends on the following repos:
 - [CORA](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/)

This repo assumes that you have installed the following libraries:
 - libboost-dev (1.71)
 - libeigen3-dev (3.3.7) in eigen3/
 - libipopt
 - libcoinhsl

#### Install Eigen3
Download `eigen-3.3.7` by following [this link](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen/-/releases/3.3.7) 

     cd ~/Downloads
     tar -xvzf eigen-3.3.7.tar.gz
     mv eigen-3.3.7 /your/favorite/path/
     cd /your/favorite/path/eigen-3.3.7
     mkdir build && cd $_
     cmake ..
     sudo make
     sudo make install
 
 libipopt and libcoinhsl could be very annoying to install and to work with Matlab. 
 Suppose libipopt and libcoinhsl are both installed in /usr/local/lib.
 You need to add that path to both user's environmental variable 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' and Matlab's environment variable 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
 Check [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/set-run-time-library-path-on-linux-systems.html) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13428910/how-to-set-the-environmental-variable-ld-library-path-in-linux) for more information.

## Start
Run 
 - initialize.m
 - kinova_src/initialize.m
 
in Matlab before you run any other scripts!
